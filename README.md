# Deto No Yoru Extension - Anime Search Tool

To get some extra practice working with Express and node-fetch, I created a potentional 'extra page' to an earlier group project, [Deto No Yoru](https://github.com/sarahdepalo/Deto_No_Yoru).

This app fetches anime search results using the [Jikan](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#) API. Currently the app will fetch the title, image url, synopsis, and url that leads to [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) for more information.
